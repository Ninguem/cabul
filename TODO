* DONE Get the project files.
Either by downloading them form the github project's page:
https://github.com/lab-rasparta-org/cabul
Or by cloning the repo (Prefered way):
git clone git@github.com:lab-rasparta-org/cabul.git

* TODO Set up the environment to lounch the help command.
Configure your window/desktop/whatever manager to run the command to open the cabul.org file in emacs using org-mode whenever you press a key or a combination of keys.
You can get away with any other text editor/viewer, but it won't be as nice.
For example, you could setup gnome so that, when you press:
C-W h
The following command gets executed:
gnome-terminal --read-conf=<gnometerminalconffile> -e "emacs <cabul.org> -f org-mode"
Of course, you will have to substitute <gnometerminalconffile> and <cabul.org> with the complete path to the actual files you want to use.
<gnometerminalconffile> is a file where you have saved the configuration from gnome terminal.
<cabul.org> is the cheatsheet.

* TODO Keep adding stuff as you discover new tricks.

* TODO Keep removing stuff as you trully learn them.

* TODO Keep committing.

* TODO Share your knowledge.

* Be happy(er).
:-)
