* cabul.org
A line starting with "* " starts a subject. Just like the one above.
A line starting with "** " is a second level subject. Just like the next one.
If you are using org-mode (you really should) put the mark (the cursor) on the same line as any of the subjects and press tab to unfold.
When done with it, press tab again to fold it back.

** How do I start?
Just edit the file and make it your own.
Don't forget to read the README and the TODO files to set up everything nicely.
You can, now, start by just deleting all of this.
Remember: its only a specially formatted text file.

** How can I help?
Send a pull request our way.
