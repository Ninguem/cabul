"CÃ¡bula" is the Portuguese word for cheatsheet. "Kabul" is a town in Afghanistan.

The idea is to have a readily available editable cheatsheet for when using the computer.
It doesn't have to be command line stuff. It could be anything, really - procedures, contacts or any other kind of documentation...
It is, also, supposed to be permanently edited to include stuff you need help remembering and to remove the things you are already comfortable with.

HOW-TO
======
1. First you'll have to grab the files.
Preferably, clone the repo with:
  $ git clone git@github.com:lab-rasparta-org/cabul.git
You can also head over to https://github.com/lab-rasparta-org/cabul and download the zip file or the tarball instead, if you want.

2. Configure your window/desktop/whatever manager to run the command to open the cabul.org file in emacs using org-mode whenever you press a key or a combination of keys.
You can get away with any other text editor/viewer, but it won't be as nice.
For example, you could setup gnome so that, when you press:
C-W h
The following command gets executed:
gnome-terminal --read-conf=<file> -e "emacs <cabul.org> -f org-mode"
Of course, you will have to substitute <file> and <cabul.org> with the complete path to the actual files you want to use.
<file> is a file where you have saved the configuration from gnome terminal.
<cabul.org> is the cheatsheet.

3. Use your Cheatsheet and be happy.
Notice you can edit it? You are supposed to do so as you go along.

BETTER
======
If you chose to clone the repo, you can now add a personal branch and track your progress that way. Just keep committing.
